#Beam Plays Brainfuck

The goal of this project was to create an interactive 
element to esoteric programing using Beam.Pro's interactive API.

Brainfuck, as an [esoteric language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), consists of only 8 
characters: `[ ] < > , . - +`

With these character's it's possible to produce actual programmatic results through memory cell manipulation, in a sort 
of ticker-tape fashion.

With the language's already high entry point of complexity, it felt like it would have been interesting to see if 
multiple strangers from the internet could successfully program in brainfuck together. It's with this idea that the 
project became a reality.
