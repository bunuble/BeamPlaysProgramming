#Beam Plays Programming

This was the [hackgt project](http://devpost.com/software/beamplaysbrainfuck) that mrmcpowned and I worked on. I'm just forking it over to my personal github

All the directories needs to be changed since it was made to work on my windows machine and my folder layout. On most windows machines, all you have to do is change the directory. Windows 8 and above users might have to slightly edit the ahk script since the ClassNN for the window box might have changed.

OS X and Linux users need to use create a new script that would behave the same.

The goal of this project was to create an interactive 
element to esoteric programing using Beam.Pro's interactive API.

Brainfuck, as an [esoteric language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), consists of only 8 
characters: `[ ] < > , . - +`

This can be done with any type of programming language but the controls have to be adjusted for each thing and esoteric languages are the easiest to do because of the limitations of the type.

With these character's it's possible to produce actual programmatic results through memory cell manipulation, in a sort 
of ticker-tape fashion.

With the language's already high entry point of complexity, it felt like it would have been interesting to see if 
multiple strangers from the internet could successfully program in brainfuck together. It's with this idea that the 
project became a reality.
